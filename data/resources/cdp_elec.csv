Exelon 2020 outlines a three-pronged strategy for achieving comprehensive GHG reductions: reduce or offset Exelon’s carbon footprint by greening our operations (Scope 1 &amp; Scope 2); help our customers and the communities we serve reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (included incremental absolute Scope 3 emission reductions); and offer more low-carbon electricity in the marketplace (include incremental absolute reductions from grid connected electricity projects).

For 2010, the average CO2 emission intensity of Idaho Power’s owned generation resources was 1,065 pounds CO2 per MWh, approximately 11 percent below the 2005 level. The average CO2 emission intensity of Idaho Power’s owned generation resources for 2011 was 681 pounds CO2 per MWh, approximately 23 percent below the 2005 level. The significant reduction in CO2 emission intensity for 2011 reflects an increase in hydro generation as a result of improved water conditions and a reduction in coal-fired generation.  In 2012, the CO2 emissions intensity was 874 pounds CO2 per MWh, approximately 27 percent below the 2005 level. These results exclude emissions assigned to purchased energy. However, given the percentage of energy purchased and the similarity between the CO2 emission profile of the regional mix and that of the company’s generation mix, purchases will not skew the data by a significant amount.

In November, 2012, the Board of Directors approved the extension of the company’s 2010-2013 goal for reducing CO2 emission intensity for a two-year period.  The goal, as revised, is to achieve CO2 emission intensity 10 -15 percent below 2005 CO2 emission intensity for the period 2010-2015.

At its May 2015 meeting, the Idaho Power Board of Directors approved an extension of Idaho Power’s carbon emissions intensity goal.  Idaho Power originally established its carbon emission intensity goal in 2009, with a target to reduce the Company’s carbon emissions intensity levels 10-15% below 2005 levels for the period of 2010-2013.  Idaho Power achieved this goal, and the board subsequently extended the carbon emissions intensity goal for 2014-2015.  This goal is also projected to be met, and in May 2015, the Idaho Power board further extended the carbon emissions intensity goal through 2016-2017, and also expanded the goal, to achieve carbon emissions intensity of 15-20% below 2005 levels for the 2010-2017 period.",,,,,,intensity,Other: Pounds CO2/MWh,0
